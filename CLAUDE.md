# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal static website project containing a single HTML page with embedded CSS styling. No build tools, package managers, or frameworks are currently in use.

## Development

To preview the site, open `index.html` directly in a browser or use any local HTTP server:

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (if npx available)
npx serve
```
